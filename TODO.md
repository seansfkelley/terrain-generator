next steps:

- concatenate two objects to the file and provide a key to switch between them
  - this will test that the usage of the VAO is correct and I can use it to switch objects to render
- render shuttle shape (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/%7Ejburkardt/data/obj/obj.html)
  - this requires being able to downconvert quads or possibly other polygons
- figure out how to use materials from the .obj for the shuttle
- implement basic shading for point light sources(http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-8-basic-shading/)
